Description: An implementation of the Depth Importance in Precision Medicine (DIPM) method 
             in Chen and Zhang (2020) <doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxaa021> and Chen and 
             Zhang (2020) <doi:10.1007/978-3-030-46161-4_16>. The DIPM method is a classification 
             tree that searches for subgroups with especially poor or strong performance in a given treatment group.
